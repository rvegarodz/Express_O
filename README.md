## Description
Express O' is a dynamic Flutter Web-App for a Coffee Shop that serves as a testament to our team's web development skills and creativity. Developed as a portfolio project for Holberton School Puerto Rico, Express O showcases our expertise in utilizing Flutter, Firebase, and Stripe to create a seamless and user-friendly online ordering system for coffee shops. From designing an intuitive user interface to implementing secure payment integration, Express O demonstrates our commitment to delivering high-quality web applications.

## Techonologies
For the development of the Express O, we used the Flutter framework and programmed in Dart, taking advantage of its cross-platform capabilities. User Authentication and Data Storage were handled using Firebase, which provides a reliable and scalable backend solution. Additionally, the payment collection functionality was implemented through integration with Stripe, a popular payment gateway, with a Go server acting as the intermediary for communication between the web app and Stripe.
