## Techonologies
For the development of the Express O, we used the Flutter framework and programmed in Dart, taking advantage of its cross-platform capabilities. User Authentication and Data Storage were handled using Firebase, which provides a reliable and scalable backend solution. Additionally, the payment collection functionality was implemented through integration with Stripe, a popular payment gateway, with a Go server acting as the intermediary for communication between the web app and Stripe.
